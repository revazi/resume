###About me
As a software developer I mainly try not to be a technology specific and get my hands on as many intereseting frameworks and tools as I can. 

During my university years I worked with several projects that involved: **C++**, **Java**, **PHP**, **JavaScript** and **Python**.

Nowadays I use my free time to learn **iOS Development** with **Swift**. For the freelance projects I use **Drupal 8** as a framework and **Docker** as an environment.

I'm not obsessed with it but yes as a text editor I use **VIM**.
