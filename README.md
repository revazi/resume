#Revaz Zakalashvili

An award winning web developer with good skills of full-stack development. As an engineer I mainly try not to be technology specific and get my hands on as many intereseting tools and frameworks as I can. I'm not obsessed with it but as a text editor I use **VIM**. During my university years I worked with several projects that involved: **PHP**, **JavaScript**, **Python** and **C++**. I've participated in various programming contests both, here in Georgia and abroad, also I've won hackaton organized by [GITA](http://gita.gov.ge/en/).

During 2016 I've worked on several **Drupal** projects, where I used **Docker** to manage environments. 

**[Tbilisi City Assembly](http://tbsakrebulo.gov.ge/?lng=eng)** - SMS sending application on Drupal 7 that enables users to send bulk notifications to predefined groups and/or single persons via local mobile communication provider [MAGTI](http://www.magticom.ge/).
