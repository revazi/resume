# Revaz Zakalashvili

An award winning web developer with good skills of full-stack development. As an engineer I mainly try not to be technology specific and get my hands on as many intereseting tools and frameworks as I can. I'm not obsessed with it but as a text editor I use **VIM**. During my university years I worked with several projects that involved: **PHP**, **JavaScript**, **Python** and **C++**. I've participated in various programming contests both, here in Georgia and abroad.

During past years I've worked mainly on **Drupal** projects, where I used **Docker** to manage environments. Currently I'm diving in [ELM](http://elm-lang.org/) and using it with **Drupal 8**.

**[Legislative Herald of Georgia](https://matsne.gov.ge/)** - Worked on document management module, which adds functionality for users to favorite documents and see the list of recently viewed ones, also developed and integrated Live Support Chat system. In addition I've added Documents parallel view and accessibility mode for the webpage.

**[Tbilisi City Assembly](http://tbsakrebulo.gov.ge/?lng=eng)** - SMS sending application on Drupal 7 that enables users to send bulk notifications to predefined groups and/or single persons via local mobile communication provider [MAGTI](http://www.magticom.ge/).

**[Educareglobal](http://educareglobal.org/)** - Created on Drupal 8. I gained good experience in theme and module development. Webpage is integrated with several payment systems([TBC](http://www.tbcbank.ge/), [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/)).
