# Revaz Zakalashvili

Highly motivated, eager to constantly learn and develop my skills, as a developer I mainly try not to be technology specific and get my hands on as many intereseting tools and frameworks as I can. I'm not obsessed with it but as a text editor I use **VIM**. During my university years I worked with several projects that involved: **PHP**, **JavaScript**, **Python** and **C++**. I've participated in various programming contests both, here in Georgia and abroad.

During past years I've worked mainly on **Frontend** and **Drupal** projects. Currently leaning towards functional programming, diving in [ELM](http://elm-lang.org/) and [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org).

**[Step Sequencer](http://zakala.me/controller/)** - Designed and developed, from scratch, using **[Processing](https://www.processing.org)** port to js - **[P5.JS](https://p5js.org)**

**[World Food Programme](http://www1.wfp.org)** - Worked on **Frontend** and **Drupal 8** tasks, gained good experience in working remotely.

**[Legislative Herald of Georgia](https://matsne.gov.ge/)** - Worked on several projects: **Documents management module** - adds functionality for users to favorite documents and see the list of recently viewed ones, **Live Chat** - support chat system, **Parallel View** - enables users to view different versions of one document paralelly and matches them while scrolling, **On Site Voice Over** - adds on site voice synthesizer that reads webpage for visually impaired people and integrates stardard shotrcuts for navigation, adds WCAG and WAI-ARIA support.

**[Tbilisi City Assembly](http://tbsakrebulo.gov.ge/?lng=eng)** - SMS sending application on Drupal 7 that enables users to send bulk notifications to predefined groups and/or single persons via local mobile communication provider [MAGTI](http://www.magticom.ge/).

**[Educareglobal](http://educareglobal.org/)** - Designed and created frontend architecture from scratch using: **Gulp**, **SASS** and **Handlebars**. For the backend I used Drupal 8 and gained good experience in theme and module development. Webpage is integrated with several payment systems([TBC](http://www.tbcbank.ge/), [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/)).
