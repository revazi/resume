###About me
As a software developer I mainly try not to be a technology specific and get my hands on as many intereseting frameworks and tools as I can. During my university years I worked with several projects that involved: **C++**, **Java**, **PHP**, **JavaScript** and **Python**. For the freelance projects I use **Drupal 8** as a development platform and **Docker** for managing different environments.

I'm not obsessed with it but yes as a text editor I use **VIM**.
